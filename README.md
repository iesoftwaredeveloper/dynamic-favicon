<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<p>
I saw an <a href="">article </a> that described how to dynamically set the favicon on a page.  It sounded like an interesting idea so I decided to give it a try.  This is the result of that attempt.  In addition to the favicon, I also included how to dynamically set an svg image within the page.
</p>

<p>
The article described how to change the favicon based upon the time of day.  I decided to allow for the change to occur based upon clicking an image that you wanted or based upon the date of the month.  <em>Note: I didn't finish the dates of the months, so if you happen to load the page on a day that is not included you will get a failure in the console.</em>
</p>
